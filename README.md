## Introduction

Machine learning researchers frequently need to experiment with different parameter configurations to fine-tune their models. Managing these configurations efficiently poses a significant challenge. 
To address this, we developed `ym2`, a configuration management framework inspired by [torchtune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune)

```bash
pip install ym2
```
